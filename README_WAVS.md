## WAVS

> [!NOTE]
> If you are running on a Mac with an ARM chip, you will need to do the following:
> - Set up Rosetta: `softwareupdate --install-rosetta`
> - Enable Rosetta (Docker Desktop: Settings -> General -> enable "Use Rosetta for x86_64/amd64 emulation on Apple Silicon")
>
> Configure one of the following networking:
> - Docker Desktop: Settings -> Resources -> Network -> 'Enable Host Networking'
> - `brew install chipmk/tap/docker-mac-net-connect && sudo brew services start chipmk/tap/docker-mac-net-connect`

### Start Environment

Start an ethereum node (anvil), the WAVS service, and deploy [eigenlayer](https://www.eigenlayer.xyz/) contracts to the local network.

```bash
cp .env.example .env

# Start the backend
#
# This must remain running in your terminal. Use another terminal to run other commands.
# You can stop the services with `ctrl+c`. Some MacOS terminals require pressing it twice.
make start-all
```

### Deploy Contract

Upload your service's trigger and submission contracts. The trigger contract is where WAVS will watch for events, and the submission contract is where the AVS service operator will submit the result on chain.

```bash
export SERVICE_MANAGER_ADDR=`make get-eigen-service-manager-from-deploy`
forge script ./script/Deploy.s.sol ${SERVICE_MANAGER_ADDR} --sig "run(string)" --rpc-url http://localhost:8545 --broadcast
```

> [!TIP]
> You can see the deployed trigger address with `make get-trigger-from-deploy`
> and the deployed submission address with `make get-service-handler-from-deploy`

## Deploy Service

Deploy the compiled component with the contracts from the previous steps. Review the [makefile](./Makefile) for more details and configuration options.`TRIGGER_EVENT` is the event that the trigger contract emits and WAVS watches for. By altering `SERVICE_TRIGGER_ADDR` you can watch events for contracts others have deployed.

```bash
# Build your service JSON
sh ./script.sh

# Deploy the service JSON
SERVICE_CONFIG_FILE=service_config.json make deploy-service
```

## Trigger the Service

Anyone can now call the [trigger contract](./src/contracts/WavsTrigger.sol) which emits the trigger event WAVS is watching for from the previous step. WAVS then calls the service and saves the result on-chain.

```bash
export COIN_MARKET_CAP_ID=1
export SERVICE_TRIGGER_ADDR=`make get-trigger-from-deploy`
forge script ./script/Trigger.s.sol ${SERVICE_TRIGGER_ADDR} ${COIN_MARKET_CAP_ID} --sig "run(string,string)" --rpc-url http://localhost:8545 --broadcast -v 4
```

## Show the result

Query the latest submission contract id from the previous request made.

```bash
# Get the latest TriggerId and show the result via `script/ShowResult.s.sol`
make show-result
```
