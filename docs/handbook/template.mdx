<Callout title="Follow the tutorial" type="info">

Before reading this guide, follow the [Oracle component tutorial](/tutorial/1-overview) to learn the basics of building a WAVS service.

</Callout>

Use the info in this guide to customize the template to create your own custom service. Check out the [WAVS design considerations](/design) page to learn which use-cases WAVS is best suited for.

## Foundry Template structure

The foundry template is made up of the following main files:

```bash
wavs-foundry-template/
├── README.md
├── makefile               # Commands, variables, and configs
├── components/            # WASI components
│   └── evm-price-oracle/
│       ├── src/
│       │   ├── lib.rs         # Main Component logic
│       │   ├── trigger.rs     # Trigger handling
│       │   └── bindings.rs    # Bindings generated by `make build`
│       └── Cargo.toml     # Component dependencies
├── compiled/              # WASM files compiled by `make build`
├── src/
│   ├── contracts/        # Trigger and submission contracts
│   └── interfaces/       # Solidity interfaces
├── script/               # Deployment scripts
├── wavs.toml             # WAVS service configuration
├── docs/                 # Documentation
└── .env                  # Private environment variables
```

- The `README` file contains the tutorial commands.
- The `makefile` contains commands for building and deploying the service. It also contains configurable variables for the service and deployment.
- The `components` directory contains the component logic for your service. Running `make wasi-build` will automatically generate bindings and compile components into the `compiled` directory.
- The `src` directory contains the Solidity contracts and interfaces for trigger and submission contracts.
- The `script` directory contains the scripts used in the makefile commands to deploy, trigger, and test the service.
- The `.env` file contains private environment variables and keys. Use `cp .env.example .env` to copy the example `.env` file.


## Toml files

There are several toml files in the template that are used to configure the service:

- `wavs.toml` is used to configure the WAVS service itself, including chains (local, testnets, mainnet) and configurations.
- `Cargo.toml` in the root directory is used to configure the workspace and includes dependencies, build settings, and component metadata.
- `/components/*/Cargo.toml` in each component directory is used to configure the Rust component and includes dependencies, build settings, and component metadata. It can inherit dependencies from the root `Cargo.toml` file using `workspace = true`.

These files can be customized to suit your specific needs, and many settings can be overridden using environment variables.

The following is an example of a component's `Cargo.toml` file structure:

```toml
[package]
name = "evm-price-oracle"
edition.workspace = true
version.workspace = true
authors.workspace = true
rust-version.workspace = true
repository.workspace = true

[dependencies]
wit-bindgen-rt ={ workspace = true }
wavs-wasi-utils = { workspace = true }
serde = { workspace = true }
serde_json = { workspace = true }
alloy-sol-macro = { workspace = true }
wstd = { workspace = true }
alloy-sol-types = { workspace = true }
anyhow = { workspace = true }

[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib"]

[profile.release]
codegen-units = 1
opt-level = "s"
debug = false
strip = true
lto = true

[package.metadata.component]
package = "component:evm-price-oracle"
target = "wavs:worker/layer-trigger-world@0.4.0-beta.1"

```
