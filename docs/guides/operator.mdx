## Requirements

Operators running WAVS will need the following minimum requirements:

### Running service components:
- RAM: at least 1 GB
- CPUs: 2

### Compile-Time Requirements:
- RAM:  at least 8GB
- Storage:  at least 30GB
- CPUs: 2

## Running a node

Because of the lightweight and portable nature of WebAssembly, WAVS operators only need to run a single binary. WAVS provides a runtime for all registered services to run, each sandboxed from the other and from the node’s operating system due to the nature of WASI. Operators will need to opt in to running different services by registering to an AVS.

## Upgrading

Updates to service logic do not require node upgrades. Instead, developers can dynamically deploy a new service component and update their service manifest to point to the component’s new version. Instead of needing to run a new Docker image every time a service is updated, operators only need to upgrade if there is a breaking change to the WAVS node software itself.
