The LLM text format presents documentation in a clean, plain text format optimized for large language models (LLMs) like Claude, ChatGPT, and others.

## llms.txt

The `llms.txt` format is a structured index of documentation pages organized by sections, including page titles, URLs and descriptions. This format is ideal for AI assistants to understand the documentation structure without processing the full content.

[https://docs.wavs.xyz/llms.txt](https://docs.wavs.xyz/llms.txt)

```
curl https://docs.wavs.xyz/llms.txt
```

## llms-full.txt

The `llms-full.txt` format returns all documentation pages as a single text document.

[https://docs.wavs.xyz/llms-full.txt](https://docs.wavs.xyz/llms-full.txt)

```
curl https://docs.wavs.xyz/llms-full.txt
```

Returns all documentation pages as a single text document.


## Markdown Format
