# WAVS Handbook Overview

This handbook outlines the main sections for building and understanding a WAVS AVS.

1. Follow the [Oracle component tutorial](/tutorial/1-overview) first to learn WAVS service basics.

2. Core Concepts:
   - [How it works](../how-it-works): Components of a WAVS AVS.
   - [Design](../design): Design considerations.

3. Services:
   - [Service](./service): Structure and manifest definition.
   - [Workflows](./workflows): Execution paths, triggers, components, submissions.
   - [Triggers](./triggers): Types of triggers (EVM, Cosmos, cron, block intervals).
   - [Submission and Aggregator](./submission): Blockchain result submission.

4. Components:
   - [Component Overview](./components/component): Lifecycle and trigger handling.
   - [Variables](./components/variables): Public and private config variables.
   - [Utilities and Crates](./components/utilities): Available tools for components.
   - [Blockchain Interactions](./components/blockchain-interactions): Smart contract and blockchain calls.
   - [Network Requests](./components/network-requests): HTTP requests to external APIs.

5. Development:
   - [Template](./template): Template structure and customization.
   - [Makefile Commands](./commands): Build, deploy, and manage commands.

Start with the Service section to grasp basics, then explore others as needed.
