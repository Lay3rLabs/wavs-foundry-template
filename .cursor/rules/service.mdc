# Service Manifest and Manager

A WAVS service is composed of smart contracts, operators, and offchain components defined in a `service.json` manifest. This manifest configures workflows, components, submission, and the service manager contract. It is hosted on IPFS or HTTP(S) and referenced by the service manager contract.

## Creating the Manifest

1. Use `wavs-cli service` or the provided [build_service.sh](https://github.com/Lay3rLabs/wavs-foundry-template/blob/main/script/build_service.sh) script to generate a single-component service manifest.
2. Define service info, workflows, components, submission, and manager details in `service.json`.
3. Upload the manifest to IPFS or a publicly accessible server (e.g., Pinata).

## Example Manifest

```json service.json

        }
    }
}
```

## Uploading the Manifest

```bash
# Upload manifest to IPFS (local or remote)
SERVICE_FILE=${SERVICE_FILE} make upload-to-ipfs

# Retrieve IPFS gateway URL
export IPFS_GATEWAY=$(sh script/get-ipfs-gateway.sh)

# Fetch uploaded content
curl "${IPFS_GATEWAY}${ipfs_cid}"

# Set service URI on service manager contract
cast send ${WAVS_SERVICE_MANAGER_ADDRESS} 'setServiceURI(string)' "${SERVICE_URI}" -r ${RPC_URL} --private-key ${DEPLOYER_PK}
```

## Service Manager Contract

- Registers operators with assigned weights; only registered operators can sign submissions.
- Maintains the service URI linking to the manifest.
- Validates operator signatures and ensures threshold weights are met before processing data.
- Ensures operators are sorted correctly for submission validation.
